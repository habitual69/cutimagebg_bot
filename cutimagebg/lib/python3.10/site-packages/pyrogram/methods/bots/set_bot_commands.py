        """Set the list of the bot's commands.
        The commands passed will overwrite any command set previously.
        This method can be used by the own bot only.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/bots.rst

        Parameters:
            commands (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.BotCommand`):
                A list of bot commands.
                At most 100 commands can be specified.

            scope (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.BotCommandScope`, *optional*):
                An object describing the scope of users for which the commands are relevant.
                Defaults to :obj:`~pyrogram.types.BotCommandScopeDefault`.

            language_code (``str``, *optional*):
                A two-letter ISO 639-1 language code.
                If empty, commands will be applied to all users from the given scope, for whose language there are no
                dedicated commands.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: On success, True is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python
