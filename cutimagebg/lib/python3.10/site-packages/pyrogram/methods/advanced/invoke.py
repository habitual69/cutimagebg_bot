        """Invoke raw Telegram functions.

        This method makes it possible to manually call every single Telegram API method in a low-level manner.
        Available functions are listed in the :obj:`functions <pyrogram.api.functions>` package and may accept compound
        data types from :obj:`types <pyrogram.api.types>` as well as bare types such as ``int``, ``str``, etc...

        .. note::

            This is a utility method intended to be used **only** when working with raw
            :obj:`functions <pyrogram.api.functions>` (i.e: a Telegram API method you wish to use which is not
            available yet in the Client class as an easy-to-use method).

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            query (``RawFunction``):
                The API Schema function filled with proper arguments.

            retries (``int``):
                Number of retries.

            timeout (``float``):
                Timeout in seconds.

            sleep_threshold (``float``):
                Sleep threshold in seconds.

        Returns:
            ``RawType``: The raw type response generated by the query.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.
