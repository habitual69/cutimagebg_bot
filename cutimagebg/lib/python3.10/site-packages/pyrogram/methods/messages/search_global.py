        """Search messages globally from all of your chats.

        If you want to get the messages count only, see :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.search_global_count`.

        .. note::

            Due to server-side limitations, you can only get up to around ~10,000 messages and each message
            retrieved will not have any *reply_to_message* field.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users.rst

        Parameters:
            query (``str``, *optional*):
                Text query string.
                Use "@" to search for mentions.
            
            filter (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.MessagesFilter`, *optional*):
                Pass a filter in order to search for specific kind of messages only.
                Defaults to any message (no filter).

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of messages to be retrieved.
                By default, no limit is applied and all messages are returned.

        Returns:
            ``Generator``: A generator yielding :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` objects.
