        You can retrieve up to 200 users at once.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            user_ids (``int`` | ``str`` | Iterable of ``int`` or ``str``):
                A list of User identifiers (id or username) or a single user id/username.
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.User` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.User`: In case *user_ids* was not a list,
            a single user is returned, otherwise a list of users is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get information about one user
                await app.get_users("me")
