        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                The group, supergroup or channel id

            user_ids (``int`` | ``str`` | List of ``int`` or ``str``):
                Users to add in the chat
                You can pass an ID (int), username (str) or phone number (str).
                Multiple users can be added by passing a list of IDs, usernames or phone numbers.

            forward_limit (``int``, *optional*):
                How many of the latest messages you want to forward to the new members. Pass 0 to forward none of them.
                Only applicable to basic groups (the argument is ignored for supergroups or channels).
                Defaults to 100 (max amount).

        Returns:
            ``bool``: On success, True is returned.
