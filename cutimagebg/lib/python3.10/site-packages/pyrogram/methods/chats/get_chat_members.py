        """Get the members list of a chat.

        A chat can be either a basic group, a supergroup or a channel.
        Requires administrator rights in channels.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            query (``str``, *optional*):
                Query string to filter members based on their display names and usernames.
                Only applicable to supergroups and channels. Defaults to "" (empty string).
                A query string is applicable only for :obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ChatMembersFilter.SEARCH`,
                :obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ChatMembersFilter.BANNED` and :obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ChatMembersFilter.RESTRICTED`
                filters only.

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of members to be retrieved.

            filter (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ChatMembersFilter`, *optional*):
                Filter used to select the kind of members you want to retrieve. Only applicable for supergroups
                and channels.

        Returns:
            ``Generator``: On success, a generator yielding :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ChatMember` objects is returned.
