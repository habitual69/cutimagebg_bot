    """A :doc:`result <InlineQueryResult>` of an inline query chosen by the user and sent to their chat partner.

    .. note::

        In order to receive these updates, your bot must have "inline feedback" enabled. You can enable this feature

            The unique identifier for the result that was chosen.

            The user that chose the result.

        query (``str``):
            The query that was used to obtain the result.

        location (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.Location`, *optional*):
            Sender location, only for bots that require user location.

        inline_message_id (``str``, *optional*):
            Identifier of the sent inline message.
            Available only if there is an :doc:`inline keyboard <InlineKeyboardMarkup>` attached to the message.
